# You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.

# Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return null.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
# Output: [2,1,3]
# Example 2:


# Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
# Output: []
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 5000].
# 1 <= Node.val <= 107
# root is a binary search tree.
# 1 <= val <= 107
