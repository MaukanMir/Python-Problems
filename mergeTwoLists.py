# Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
# Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
# Example 2:

# Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
# Output: []
# Example 3:

# Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
# Output: [0]
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
